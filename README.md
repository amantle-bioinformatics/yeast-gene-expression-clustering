# yeast-gene-expression-clustering
A bioinformatics project analyzing gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using machine learning clustering. Using the Spellman dataset, it identifies co-expressed genes across the yeast cell cycle through K-means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN methods, revealing patterns in temporal gene regulation.
